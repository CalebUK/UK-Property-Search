### Summary of what this does:
1.  **Scrapes Gov.uk** to find the *actual* rating file.
2.  **Downloads** the main school list (locations).
3.  **Joins** them together on the School ID (URN).
4.  **Saves** a unified JSON file that your website reads.

Now, whether you look at a school in Winnersh or a school in Manchester, it will have the correct location, nursery info, AND the latest Ofsted rating.
